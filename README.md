# trackee

trackee is an app built for the iOS platform to track and save our learning resources in the app. I built this because usually we don't document or save our resources, and when we want to access that resource again we forget the name of the web or books. 
trackee also has a Pomodoro timer for our learning for about 25 minutes, so our learning could be tracked properly.
